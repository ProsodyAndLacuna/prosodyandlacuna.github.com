Working from an English translation of French \r\nsymbolist [Stéphane Mallarmé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stéphane_Mallarmé)’s \r\npoem _Un coup de dés jamais n’abolira le hasard (A throw of the dice will never abolish chance)_, \r\nartist [Erin Mickelson](http://erinmickelson.com) has completed a series of translations in a number of forms, \r\nincluding typography, movement, movement notation (Labanotation), nonlinear mathematics, and time-based \r\ndigital animation.\r\n\r\nThe computer code written to create the mathematical translation and digital animation is available here with an open-source license in the hope that artists and programmers will adapt it to either expand on the project or create new works.\r\n\r\n## Source Code\r\n\r\n### dejong\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/ProsodyAndLacuna/dejong](https://github.com/ProsodyAndLacuna/dejong)\r\n\r\n### build-scripts\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/ProsodyAndLacuna/build-scripts](https://github.com/ProsodyAndLacuna/build-scripts)\r\n\r\n### libdejong\r\n\r\nA Ruby Gem for generating a DeJong attractor from precomputed data.\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/ProsodyAndLacuna/libdejong](https://github.com/ProsodyAndLacuna/libdejong)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
