_Prosody & [...]_ is an exploration in translation presented in a coalescence of traditional book 
form and electronic media. Working from an English translation of French 
symbolist [Stéphane Mallarmé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stéphane_Mallarmé)’s 
poem _Un coup de dés jamais n’abolira le hasard (A throw of the dice will never abolish chance)_, 
artist [Erin Mickelson](http://erinmickelson.com) has completed a series of translations in a number of forms, 
including typography, movement, movement notation (Labanotation), nonlinear mathematics, and time-based 
digital animation.

The computer code written to create the mathematical translation and digital animation is available here with an open-source license in the hope that artists and programmers will adapt it to either expand on the project or create new works.
