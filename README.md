Prosody & [...] is an exploration in translation presented in a coalescence of traditional book form and electronic media. Working from an English translation of French symbolist Stéphane Mallarmé’s poem _Un coup de dés jamais n’abolira le hasard (A throw of the dice will never abolish chance)_, artist Erin Mickelson has completed a series of translations in a number of forms, including typography, movement, movement notation (Labanotation), nonlinear mathematics, and time-based digital animation.

The computer code written to create the mathematical translation and digital animation is available here with an open-source license in the hope that artists and programmers will adapt it to either expand on the project or create new works.

Source code will be available shortly!
